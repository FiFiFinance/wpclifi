# wpclifi

There are some commands that I'm missing.  Maybe there's already an implementation that I haven't found yet.

I'll start by documenting what I want.  If I haven't found an existing alternative I'll start implementing this in due time.

## wp uli

`uli` is `drush`'s way of automatically logging into a site.

## wp ssh

With `ssh` you can `ssh` onto the remote box. Nothing else needed.
